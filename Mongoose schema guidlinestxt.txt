Global Rule (Applies Everywhere)

Facts are created first.
Derived data is updated after.
History is never overwritten.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Correct Mental Model (Very Important)
Product answers:

“What is the product?”

RoleAssignment answers:

“Who has authority over what, and when?”

Team / Program Manager answers:

“Who executes or governs?”

These are separate concerns and must stay separate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ Product Managers (product-scoped, not team-scoped)
Product Managers do NOT belong to a team. They belong to Product

3️⃣ Program Managers (team-scoped, not product-scoped)
Program Managers do NOT belong to Product

4️⃣ Teams associated with Product (Implicit, not stored)
Teams are linked to products via TestingSession, not directly.
